# TODO

- Need to set starting capitals for each player
- Need to take whether a cell is active or not into consideration (only the capitals and immediately surrounding tiles start active)
- Need to add a game isOver state to game object
- Need to take into consideration win condition when making a move to see if game is over
- Need to take capital capture into consideration (capital goes away and turn stays the same)
