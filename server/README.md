# TODO

- API pagination?
- Link inviting? (needs client routing component as well)
- Authentication?
  - But also still want option for anonymous drop in link games
  - create "ghost" user account when user joins game from invite, just has a display name, guid username or w/e
  - if they register or sign in, assign ghost user's games to actual user, merging if necessary
